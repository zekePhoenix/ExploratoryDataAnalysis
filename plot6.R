#Question 6
# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City?

# Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor 
# vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). 
# Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

#Find nei data for vehilces
